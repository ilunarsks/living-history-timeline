# Living History Timeline Project

## Project Overview
This is a semester-long, project-based learning unit where students collaboratively build an interactive digital timeline focused on **"The Space Race"** (1955–1975). The project uses GitHub not just for code, but as a central hub for project management, content creation, and peer review—simulating a real-world development team.

## Learning Objectives
- **Collaborative Development**: Learn to work in a distributed team using Git/GitHub workflows (forking, branching, pull requests, code review).
- **Project Management**: Practice breaking a large project into manageable tasks using Issues, Milestones, and Assignees.
- **Content Creation & Curation**: Research historical events, write concise summaries, gather reliable sources, and present them in a structured format.
- **Web Development Skills**: Build a functional, interactive timeline website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Quality Assurance**: Participate in peer review processes, give and receive constructive feedback, and ensure content accuracy.

## Final Deliverable
A fully functional, interactive timeline website that:
- Displays Space Race events in chronological order.
- Includes event details (date, title, description, images, source links).
- Is visually appealing and responsive.
- Is hosted on GitHub Pages (or a similar platform) by the end of the semester.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Main page of the timeline.
- `css/style.css` – Styles for the timeline and layout.
- `js/main.js` – JavaScript for interactivity (filtering, modal pop‑ups, etc.).
- `data/events.json` – A JSON file containing all timeline events, structured for easy rendering.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork locally and create a new branch for your task (`feature/event-name` or `fix/issue-description`).
3. **Claim an Issue** by assigning it to yourself (go to the Issues tab, find an unassigned Issue, and assign it).
4. **Do the work**: research the event, add it to `data/events.json`, and update the front‑end code if needed.
5. **Commit & push** your changes to your branch, then open a **Pull Request** back to the main repository.
6. **Link the Issue** in your PR description with `Closes #XX` so the issue is automatically closed when the PR is merged.
7. **Address review comments** from your peers and the instructor before merging.

## Milestones
The project is divided into three phases, each with a corresponding GitHub Milestone:
- **Phase 1: Research & Planning** (Due: Week 4)
- **Phase 2: Content & Functionality** (Due: Week 10)
- **Phase 3: Polish & Presentation** (Due: Week 14)
